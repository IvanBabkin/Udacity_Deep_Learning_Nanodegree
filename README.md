## [Project 2 - Landmark Classification and Tagging for Social Media](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Landmark%20Classification%20and%20Tagging%20for%20Social%20Media)
The purpose of this project is to build CNNs models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. Firstly, two different CNN models are built from scratch using PyTorch, experimenting with model architecture, weight initialisation and other hyperparameters. Secondly, VGG16 and ResNet50 models' architectures are adjusted to suit while their pre-trained weights are similarly used to make more accurate predictions on the dataset. The performance of the models is compared and contrasted, and ultimately, the best model is chosen to classify images based on the visible landmarks. 

* Key techniques used:
  * Creating and training CNNs models with PyTorch
  * Improving CNN performance through optimizer and model hyperparameter tuning
  * Transfer Learning
